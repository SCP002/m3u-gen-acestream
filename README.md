# m3u-gen-acestream

## What is this?

> M3U playlist generator for Ace Stream.

## How it works?

It fetches available channels from ace stream engine using API, filters and transforms them and writes
M3U playlists using templates defined in config.

## Notes

To use it, VPN or proxy might be required as some ISP block connections to acestream servers.

## Requirements

[Ace Stream](https://docs.acestream.net/products/) running locally or remotely.
